FULL STACK INTERN ASSESSMENT 

Assignment: Build a Blog Application

Requirements:
-	The application should allow users to create, view, and manage blog posts with the following features:
-	User authentication using email and password.
-	Only logged-in users can create blogs.
-	Each blog should have a title and content.
-	Once published, blogs should be viewable by everyone (even unauthenticated users).
-	There should be a public page that lists all blogs with pagination.
-	Blogs should be stored in a SQL or NoSQL database.
-	The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
-	The application should be built using a front-end framework such as React, Angular, or Vue and a back-end framework such as Laravel, Django, or Spring boot.
-	The application should be hosted on a cloud-based platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

Instructions:
-	Choose a front-end framework and a back-end framework to use for the project.
-	Build the user interface of the application using the front-end framework. The following pages are required:
-	Signup / Login page
-	Blog creation page (accessible only to logged-in users)
-	Blog listing page (public, with pagination)
-	Blog detail page (public, shows full content)
-	Blog edit/delete options (only for blog authors)
-	Build the backend API of the application using the back-end framework. Include endpoints for user authentication and blog CRUD operations.
-	Connect the front-end and back-end of the application using HTTP requests.
-	Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
-	Deploy the application to a cloud-based platform.

Submission:
-	Submit the source code for the application on a version control system such as Git.
-	Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application.
-	Deploy the application to a cloud-based platform and provide the URL.
-	Create a short video recording on Loom, walking us through the assignment. 

Note: This assignment is designed to test your skills in building a full-stack web application with authentication, data persistence, and RESTful APIs. We are looking for clean and efficient code, attention to detail, and the ability to work with both front-end and back-end technologies. Good luck!
