# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a full-stack blog application that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts. The application features user authentication, blog management capabilities, and public blog viewing with pagination. The system will be built using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
