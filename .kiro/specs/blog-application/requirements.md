# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a full-stack blog application that allows users to create, view, and manage blog posts. The application features user authentication, blog management capabilities, and public blog viewing with pagination. The system will be built using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to register and login with email and password, so that I can create and manage my own blog posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the signup page THEN the system SHALL display email and password input fields with validation
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to login
3. WHEN a user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display email and password input fields
5. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and provide access to protected features
6. WHEN a user submits invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
7. WHEN an authenticated user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect to public pages

### Requirement 2: Blog Creation and Management

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create, edit, and delete my blog posts, so that I can share my content and maintain control over my publications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the blog creation page THEN the system SHALL display title and content input fields
2. WHEN an authenticated user submits a valid blog post THEN the system SHALL save the post and make it publicly viewable
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access blog creation THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
4. WHEN a blog author views their own blog post THEN the system SHALL display edit and delete options
5. WHEN a blog author edits their post THEN the system SHALL update the content and maintain the original publication date
6. WHEN a blog author deletes their post THEN the system SHALL remove it from public view and confirm the deletion
7. WHEN a non-author views a blog post THEN the system SHALL NOT display edit or delete options

### Requirement 3: Public Blog Viewing

**User Story:** As any visitor (authenticated or not), I want to view all published blog posts with pagination, so that I can browse and read content easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user visits the blog listing page THEN the system SHALL display all published blogs with pagination
2. WHEN a user clicks on a blog title THEN the system SHALL navigate to the full blog detail page
3. WHEN a user navigates through pagination THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate page of blog posts
4. WHEN a user views a blog detail page THEN the system SHALL display the full title, content, author, and publication date
5. WHEN there are no blog posts THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
6. WHEN the blog listing page loads THEN the system SHALL show blogs in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile, so that I can access and use all features regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a fully functional interface optimized for larger screens
2. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for smaller screens
3. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation elements and feedback
4. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and success/error messages
5. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with guidance

### Requirement 5: Data Persistence and API

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all data to be securely stored in PostgreSQL with a RESTful API, so that the application can reliably manage users and blog posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL store user credentials securely in the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a blog post is created THEN the system SHALL persist it in the database with proper relationships to the author
3. WHEN the frontend requests data THEN the backend SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints for all operations
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate authentication for protected endpoints
5. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity
6. WHEN the system starts THEN the database SHALL be properly initialized with required tables and relationships
